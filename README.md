# smlisp

_smlisp_ is a sufficiently complicated C program by **Greenspun's tenth rule**.

In other words, it is an ad-hoc, informally specified, bug-ridden, slow
implementation of half of Common Lisp.

Its purpose is educational, namely to learn and teach C language,
parser and interpreter programming and some useful data structures
and techniques (and why not, some LISP). All this by studying and
developing a complex project.

THIS IS A TOY! DO NOT USE FOR ANYTHING SERIOUS! NO GUARANTEES!
